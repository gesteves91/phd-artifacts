# Chapter 4 Machine Learning Models

Due to GitHub limitations, we cannot store the models in this repository. Instead, we uploaded them to Zenodo and provided the link [here](https://zenodo.org/record/7513974).

You can cite the models as follows:

```bibtex
@dataset{models_usxgb_23,
  author = {G. E. dos Santos},
  title  = {US-XGB Models for Defect Prediction},
  year   = {2023},
  url    = {https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7513974}
}
```
